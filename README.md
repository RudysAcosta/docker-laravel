# 🚀 MySQL Rocketship with Laravel 🚀

---

👋 Howdy, Space Cowboys and Cowgirls! 🤠 Get ready to hitch a ride on the MySQL Rocketship as we journey through the deep space of Docker containers and Laravel constellations! 🌌 Buckle up and hold on to your space hats - it's going to be a wild ride! 🚀

## 🌟 Step 1: Building a Space Base 🌟

Before we start zapping through galaxies, let's build our space base to store the invaluable cosmic artifacts (MySQL data, of course).

Grab your space shovel:
```bash
mkdir mysql
```

BAM! 💥 You’ve got yourself a space base!

## 🛸 Step 2: Lift-off 🛸

Now, let’s fuel up the rocket and lift-off into space! 🚀
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Feel the gravitational pull as your services are now space-bound!

## 🌙 Step 3: Resupply the Space Station 🌙

Uh-oh! We forgot some space cargo! 📦 Time to install some new shiny space gadgets without any space debris (*).
```bash
docker-compose run --rm composer require
```

What’s that? You want some alien technology? 👽 Grab npm packages while hovering over the moon.
```bash
docker-compose run --rm npm install
```

## 🛰 Step 4: Assembling the Artisan Space Probe 🛰

Need a handy probe for exploring the vast Laravel cosmos? Say no more!
```bash
docker-compose run --rm artisan make:model Post --migration
```
Behold, the Artisan Space Probe, ready for interstellar missions! 🌌🔭

## 🌠 Step 5: Setting Coordinates on the Galactic Map 🌠

Before we zoom any further, let’s make sure we don’t get lost in this infinite Laravel nebula. Set your Space GPS!

```bash
sudo nano laravel-docker.test
```

Put on your space glasses, we're about to edit the HOSTS file on your local machine. This ancient scroll contains the sacred mappings of domains to IP addresses. 🗺️✨

Once you're inside the editor, paste the following cosmic coordinates to your Galactic Map.
```bash
127.0.0.1 laravel-docker.test
```

Press CTRL + X to exit, then Y and Enter to save the file! 🛸

## 🌍 Step 6: Colonizing a New World 🌍

It’s time to colonize a brave new world! But this time, in production. Fire the thrusters!
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build nginx
```

Congratulations, Space Explorer! 🎉 You've established an interstellar Laravel colony! 🌍💫
